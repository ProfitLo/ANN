Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Algorithm

This repository contains the implementation of an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) algorithm. ANNs are computational models inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns and relationships from data. This implementation provides a flexible framework for building and training ANNs for various tasks such as regression, classification, and pattern recognition.
